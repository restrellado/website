## If you're a K–12 educator who wants to learn to use data confidently in your everyday work, I want to help. 

My name is Ryan Estrellado, and I'm the author of the upcoming book *The K–12 Educator's Data Guidebook: Reimagining Practical Data Use in Schools*, which will be out in late 2021. I'm writing this book as a how-to guide for data that speaks to you, the educator. 

### Sign Up for My Practical Data Tips Newsletter

Here's the good news: you don't have to wait until the book comes out to start learning practical data activities that you can use at work today. [Sign up for my practical data activity newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/25cd9ce3ce44/k12-educators-data-activities) and join a community of people learning to get started with data. 

### Be the First to Know When You Can Pre-Order the Book

Follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ry_estrellado/) and you'll be the first to know when *The K–12 Educator's Data Guidebook* is available for pre-order. I also post [writing tips](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPo1cxkAQhr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and pictures of my cute dog, [Marcy](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQM4ltEIIYe/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). 

### For Aspiring Data Scientists in Education

If you're an educator interested in bringing data science to your job and you don't know where to start, I can help with that too. I wrote a book with four amazing co-authors called *Data Science in Education Using R*. [Buy it in print here](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Education-Using-R/dp/0367422255/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=data+science+in+education+using+r&qid=1624421665&sr=8-3). You can also [read it for free here](https://datascienceineducation.com).
